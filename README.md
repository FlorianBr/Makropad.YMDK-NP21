Cheap macropad from Aliexpress. For some reason the hardware of my pad differs from the YMDK NP32 in the QMK branch. It has a Atmel 32U4 and obviously a different pinning. Besides that nothing special there, I modify its mapping and use it mostly to launch apps, to control my linux workspaces and desktops

 - Keys: Gateron Red
 - Keycaps: Leftovers and transparent caps
